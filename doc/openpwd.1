.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
OpenPwd is a convenient and simple password manager that uses dmenu(1)
and xclip(1) to interact with the user.
Passwords are saved in ~/.openpwd by default, can be changed setting the
environment variable OPENPWD_FILE.
.PP
It has the following extra features:
.IP "1." 3
Everything is saved in a file, unlike pass(1) which saves one file per
credential.
.IP "2." 3
Usernames are encrypted, unlike pass(1).
.IP "3." 3
The file size is always the same, this allows denying the existence of
all the passwords.
(Mr.\ Judge, I have forgotten the password, but I swear to you that the
password file is empty).
.IP "4." 3
A redundant salt can be added to the passwords, this allows to hide part
of the password in your memory.
(Mr.\ Judge, here is the password that decrypts the password database,
the one that decrypts that file is not inside, sorry).
.IP "5." 3
AES256 encryption is used.
.IP "6." 3
Passwords never touch the disk decrypted, RAM is used at all times.
.SH SESSION TIMEOUT
.PP
The OpenPwd program does not leave any process in the background.
The session is saved in the user's shared memory.
.PP
To log out when there is no activity, for example in an hour of
inactivity, you \f[I]must\f[] add the following task to your crontab(5)
file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
5\ *\ *\ *\ *\ openpwd\ \-c\ 3600\ /clear
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Read the cron(1) manual for more information.
.SH IMPORT PASS(1) PASSWORDS
.PP
Passwords can be imported from pass(1) with the following command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
openpwd\ /import\ ~/.password\-store
\f[]
.fi
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
.PP
Running the program without arguments runs it in interactive mode.
.PP
In interactive mode once the password file is unlocked the user is
presented with the list of saved credentials and the available commands.
Commands begin with \[lq]/\[rq].
.PP
If there is a URL (for example https://servicio.com/login) in the
clipboard the program first lists the credentials that contain the
domain, for example example \[lq]service.com/user1\[rq] and
\[lq]service.com/user2\[rq].
.PP
Once a credential is selected the username is saved in the X selection
\[lq]primary\[rq] and the password in \[lq]clipboard\[rq].
.PP
You can access the user with the middle mouse button.
To the password with CTRL\-P or paste.
.PP
The commands are the same as non\-interactive mode.
.SH NON\-INTERACTIVE MODE
